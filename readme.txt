It supported an unlimited amount of teams and results. There's a location management to describe if the match was played outside or at home (useful for sport team)

One can configure how many results to be displayed on the front page. To show all the result there is a link on the front page that opens a lightbox with a table containing
all the results. There is also filters on that table to browse the results more efficiently.

It is also possible to add a specific tag to a post or a page. The tag will be replace by a table containing all the results. The tag to used is [team_results].
